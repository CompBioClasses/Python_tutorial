    "# Key facts about mutable/immutable objects (assignment)\n",
    "\n",
    "- If you use assignment (=) to make a copy of an *immutable* object, the assignment will do what you expect because the underlying data cannot be changed.\n",
    "- If you use assignment to make a copy of a *mutable* object, **only a shallow copy is made**. That means the copy is merely a reference to the same data as contained in the original (it is essentially just a link to that data). This is much faster and uses less memory than a \"deep copy\", where all the data is duplicated into a new area of memory, but it means that if you change the data with one of the variables, you have also changed it for the other one."
