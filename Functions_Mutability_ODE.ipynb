    "In the cell above, you defined a function that represent an ordinary differential equation (ODE). This is a standard differential equation in mathematical biology representing a population that grows *logistically* with effective growth rate $r$ and carrying capacity $K$. Solutions (for $r,K>0$ and initial conditions strictly between 0 and $K$) look like sigmoid curves.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's a non-stiff ODE and once we supply an initial condition, it can easily be solved numerically using standard methods like Runge-Kutta 4(5) - also known as RK45, which is what ode45 in MATLAB uses. SciPy has this (and other) methods for solving ODE implemented as functions, so we can make use of the SciPy library to solve rather than writing a solver from scratch. This is true for many common numerical methods that are generally applicable - always see if there is something you can use in SciPy before trying to write your own!\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, we will make use of the `solve_ivp` function located in the `scipy.integrate` module. It's documentation can be found [here](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.integrate.solve_ivp.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll also plot the solution to the ODE!\n",
    "\n",
    "The main plotting library in Python is [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/), which is in the same ecosystem as NumPy, SciPy, and Jupyter. If you are coming from MATLAB, you're in luck - the syntax for matplotlib was directly inspired by MATLAB.\n",
    "\n",
    "Matplotlib is a giant library capable of all kinds of visualizations, including interactive plots and animation/video. There is a complex backend that deals with things like color and drawing artists, and making matplotlib work on different operating systems and in different contexts (like embedded in a Jupyter notebook). The part of matplotlib that gives you the actual plotting functions is called **pyplot**.\n",
