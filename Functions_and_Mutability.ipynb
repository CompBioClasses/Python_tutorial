    "Let's discuss the pieces of this. First, the function name.\n",
    "- It is good practice to use only lowercase letters for the name of functions and variables.\n",

    "- Inside the parentheses, you list (separated by commas) the variables the function should take in.\n",
    "- These variables exist ONLY inside the function. That means:\n",
    "    - If there is an `x` variable outside the function, this `x` is different from that one and they won't interact in any way. (**But** the data it contains MAY NOT be different. More on this below.)\n",
    "    - You cannot access the variable `x` outside of this function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Best practice is to include a multi-line comment at the top of each function using triple quotations (single or double). This is called the \"docstring\". Help functions and intellisense can access it, which means that VS Code can remind you how to use your own function if you write it well!\n",
    "- The first line of the docstring is a brief discriptor of what the function does.\n",
    "- You can add a longer description under that as-needed.\n",
    "- There should be a section called \"Args\" or \"Arguments\" or \"Parameters\" which lists (in order) what the function expects to take in.\n",
    "- Good practice is to include the type of variable each argument expects. Here, a floating point number, which means any decimal (including integers)\n",

You want to think of a function as a black box with clear ins and outs: it takes data in through its parentheses and spits data out through its return. Everything else is internal to that function only."
