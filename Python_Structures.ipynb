    "2. Code cells. These contain code (Python, R, or Julia) and when run, any assigned variables are added to RAM and any results are printed below the cell.\n",

    "The goal of this notebook is to give you a quick introduction to the basic data structures in Python. Single numerical and boolean values (True, False) can be assigned to variables in Python with the equals sign, e.g. `x=2` stores the value 2 in the variable x. You can similarly assign letters and words (called \"strings\", more on this below) to variables, as well as container objects which can hold many values.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ability to choose between many different types of container objects is a key feature of Python and one of the main things that makes it more flexible than MATLAB or R. It is very important that you learn these basic data structures and when to use them.\n",
    "\n",
    "***Therefore*** *you will have a quiz on the contents of this notebook*. The quiz will be limited to only the information below, but you should try to read more about each one of these structures that I will mention because we will use them constantly. \n",
    "\n",
    "[This page in the Python documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/introduction.html) is a good place to go for more basic information on the built-in data structures, and you can read more about NumPy arrays in the numpy documentation. **PLEASE READ** all of 3.1.\n",

    "\n",
    "One extremely important concept in Python is that *everything* you can assign to a variable in Python is classified as either *mutable* or *immutable*. Mutable data types can be changed after they are created without completely overwritting all of the data. Examples include appending to a list or replacing the first-row, first-column number in a 3x3 matrix with a different number. Immutable data types cannot be altered once they are created without completely deleting and rewriting them. Trying to alter them in-place will produce an error.\n",

This makes lists very versatile. It is also computationally fast to append to a list and to remove the last entry of the list. Lists are denoted with square brackets. You should use a list whenever you will need to add or remove things, making it longer or shorter in the process."
