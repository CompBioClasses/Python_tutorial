    "# Continuous-Time Markov Chains: The Yule-Furry Process\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will simulate a continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC) and \n",
    "compare the results to known analytical formulas. The example we will use is \n",
    "the **Yule-Furry process**, also known as the linear birth process.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall from the board that in this process, each individual independently gives \n",
    "birth at rate $\\beta$. When the population size is $n$, the total birth rate is \n",
    "$n\\beta$. Since there are no deaths, the population can only grow.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why are inter-event times exponentially distributed?\n",
    "\n",
    "The defining property of a CTMC is that it is *memoryless*: the future depends \n",
    "only on the current state, not on how long the system has been in that state. \n",
    "The exponential distribution is the unique continuous distribution with this \n",
    "memoryless property â€” if $T \\sim \\text{Exp}(\\lambda)$, then \n",
    "$P(T > t + s \\mid T > t) = P(T > s)$ for all $t, s \\geq 0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a single individual with birth rate $\\beta$, the time until its next birth \n",
    "is $\\text{Exp}(\\beta)$. When there are $n$ independent individuals each with \n",
    "rate $\\beta$, the time until the *first* birth among all of them is the minimum \n",
    "of $n$ independent exponentials. A standard result from probability is that the \n",
    "minimum of $n$ independent $\\text{Exp}(\\beta)$ random variables is \n",
    "$\\text{Exp}(n\\beta)$. So when the population is $n$, the time until the next \n",
    "event is exponentially distributed with rate $n\\beta$ (equivalently, mean \n",
    "$1/(n\\beta)$).\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Gillespie algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Gillespie algorithm** (also called the stochastic simulation algorithm) is \n",
    "a general method for exactly simulating CTMCs. The idea is simple: rather than \n",
    "advancing time in fixed steps and checking whether events occur (which would \n",
    "require very small time steps for accuracy), we jump directly from one event to \n",
    "the next. At each step:\n",
    "1. Compute the total rate of all possible events given the current state.\n",
    "2. Draw the time until the next event from the corresponding exponential \n",
    "distribution.\n",
    "3. Determine which event occurs (in our case there is only one type â€” a birth).\n",
    "4. Update the state and repeat.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is exact (no discretization error) and efficient, since we skip over all \n",
    "the dead time between events. For the Yule-Furry process, the algorithm is \n",
    "particularly simple because there is only one type of event (birth), so step 3 \n",
    "is trivial."
